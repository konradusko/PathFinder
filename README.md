## About Project
This is my visualization of A* algorithm.
Algorithm calculates the lowest F cost by adding g cost (distance from start node ) and h cost(distance from end node).
You can see F cost only if you check input and you are using large size.
Algorithm counts open (still possible to check) and closed nodes(checked).
